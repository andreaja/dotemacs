In Emacs, this file should be read in -*- Outline -*- mode.

* Introduction

This directory contains an Emacs mode for Scala programs. This mode
works only in GNU Emacs 21.1 or later. In particular, it doesn't work
on any version of XEmacs, or any 20.x version of GNU Emacs.

The mode is currently very basic, and offers:

  - syntax highlighting,

  - primitive automatic indentation,

  - support for interaction with the Scala interpreter.

* Installation

Put all ".el" files in a location where Emacs can find them, i.e. a
directory appearing in the "load-path" variable.

Compile all ".el" files (optional but recommended).

Add the following line to your Emacs startup file, usually "~/.emacs":

  (require 'scala-mode-auto)

Restart Emacs or evaluate the above line.

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala"
automatically turns Scala mode on. It can also be turned on manually
using the "scala-mode" command.

* Known limitations

This Emacs mode is currently very basic because we only have very
little time to work on it. Patches for it will therefore be happily
accepted.

** Automatic indentation

Automatic indentation is incredibly basic and doesn't work correctly
in many situations, including:

  - multi-line "case" statements, e.g.

      case Pair(x,y) =>
        Console.println(x);
        Console.println(y);   // not indented correctly

  - multi-line "case" patterns, e.g.

      case 'a' | 'b' | 'c'
         | 'd' | 'e' | 'f'    // not indented correctly

  - multi-line comments, e.g.

      /*
       *                      // not indented correctly
       */                     // not indented correctly

  - other cases of single-line constructs as soon as they span
    multiple lines.
